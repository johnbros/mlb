play The play records contain the events of the game. Each play record has 6 fields after "play".

1. The first field is the inning, an integer starting at 1.

2. The second field is either 0 (for visiting team) or 1 (for home team).

3. The third field is the Retrosheet player id of the player at the plate.

4. The fourth field is the count on the batter when this particular event (play) occurred. Most games prior to 1988 do not have this information, and in such cases, "??" appears in this field.

5. The fifth field is of variable length and contains all pitches to this batter in this plate appearance and is described below. If pitches are unknown, this field is left empty with nothing in between the commas.

6. The sixth field describes the play or event that occurred.

play,5,1,ramir001,00,,S8.3-H;1-2
A play record ending in a number sign, #, indicates that there is some uncertainty in the play. Occasionally, a com record may follow providing additional information. A play record may also contain exclamation points, "!" indicating an exceptional play and question marks "?" indicating some uncertainty in the play, "+" indicating a hard hit ball, and "-" for softly hit balls. These characters can be safely ignored.

play,3,1,kearb001,??,,PB.2-3#
com,"Not sure if PB, may have been wild pitch"
The event is the most complex of all the fields and is described in detail below.



The event field of the play record
The sixth field, event, describes the play which occurred. This field is variable in length and has three main portions which define the Retrosheet scoring system.

The first part of an event is a description of the basic play.

The second part is a modifier for the first part and is separated from it with a forward slash, "/". In fact, there may be more than one modifier. A typical use of modifiers is to specify hit locations. For example, "D8/78" indicates a double fielded by the center fielder on a ball hit to left center. A complete list of modifiers excepting hit locations is given below. When more than one modifier is used, each is introduced by a "/".

The third part describes the advance of any runners, separated from the earlier parts by a period. A successful advance is indicated by a dash, "-". An out made while advancing is indicated by an X. 2-3 indicates a runner has advanced from second to third on the play. 1X2 indicates the runner was out at second advancing from first. If a base runner is not listed as advancing he remains on the base he was on. In some cases lack of advance is indicated explicitly by an advance starting and ending on the same base such as 3-3 . When put outs are made on base runners the advance field indicates fielding data and errors if they occur. See below for a complete description for advances. Note that any advances after the first are separated by semicolons.

For example, the event "S9/L9S.2-H;1-3" should be read as: single fielded by the right fielder, line drive to short right field. The runner on 2nd scored (advanced to home), and the runner on first advanced to third.

Many event descriptions require information in the form of numbers. The meaning of a particular number depends on where it appears in the event. For the descriptions that follow the following notation will be used:

Fielders will be represented by a number in the range 1 (pitcher) to 9 (right fielder) using a dollar sign, "$". When two $ symbols are used, $$, this is understood to mean a sequence of two or more fielders.
Bases are represented by a percent sign, "%", representing one of five characters, 1, 2 and 3 for first through third; B or H for home. B is used when a batter advance must be explicitly given. Scoring is indicated by an advance that reaches home, H.

Many examples of plays scored using the Retrosheet system will be given in this document. For some interesting and extreme cases check the Retrosheet strange and unusual plays listing.

The example plays have been chosen to illustrate how events are coded. Some of these events are exceedingly rare.

There is occasionally more than one event for each plate appearance, such as stolen bases, wild pitches, and balks in which the same batter remains at the plate. On these occasions the pitch sequence is interrupted by a period, and there is another play record for the resumption of the batter's plate appearance.

For purposes of description, it is convenient to separate the event types into two categories: those involving the batter at the plate and base running plays that do not involve the batter.

Events made by the batter at the plate
$ A single fielder represents an unassisted out made by the specified fielder. Modifiers can be added to indicate the batted ball trajectory: G for ground ball, L for line drive, P for pop up, F for a fly ball BG for bunt grounder, BP for bunt pop up. The ball trajectory code may be followed by a hit location code.

play,7,0,saboc001,01,CX,8/F78
indicates a fly ball caught by the center fielder in left center field.
A sacrifice fly is indicated by the modifier SF following a fly out play. The runner scoring because of the sacrifice is coded in the advance part of the play.

play,5,0,grifk001,10,.BX,9/SF.3-H
In the case that a fielder makes an unassisted out on a ground ball a modifier G follows the event.

play,5,0,duncm001,00,X,3/G.2-3
indicates an unassisted out made by the first baseman with the runner on second advancing to third.
$$ Strings of two or more fielders as an event specify a ground out where the put out is credited by the last fielder in the string. Other fielders are credited with assists.

play,6,0,davie001,01,FX,63/G6M
indicates a ground ball out at first on a ball fielded by the shortstop.
play,9,1,pendt001,00,X,143/G1
More than one player can touch the ball before an out is made. In this case, the pitcher has deflected the ball before the second baseman threw to first base.

play,7,1,tempg001,00,X,54(B)/BG25/SH.1-2
If the putout is made at a base not normally covered by the fielder the base runner, batter in this example, is given explicitly.

Force outs are indicated by adding the FO modifier and indicating the base runner forced.

play,5,0,gileb001,10,BX,54(1)/FO/G5.3-H;B-1
The runner on first is forced at second by a throw from the third baseman to the second baseman. The runner on third scores and the batter is safe at first. The explicit advance indicated for the batter is optional. A second modifier is used to indicate the batted ball trajectory and location.
With the addition of a SH modifier this form is used to indicate sacrifice hits or bunts that advance a runner.

play,6,1,camik001,00,X,23/SH.1-2
$(%)$ $$(%)$ Events of this form are used to code grounded into double plays.

play,7,0,backw001,11,FBX,64(1)3/GDP/G6
indicates a grounded into double play. The parenthesized 1 indicates the base runner on first was the initial out on the play. The GDP modifier is followed by a another / and a hit type and location.
play,8,1,smito001,22,BFCBX,4(1)3/G4/GDP
An unassisted ground ball out by the second baseman starts this double play.

$(B)$(%) followed by the modifier LDP is used to indicate a lined into double play.

play,7,0,leonj001,01,CX,8(B)84(2)/LDP/L8
indicates a line drive out to the center fielder with the runner on second doubled up.
play,7,0,fernt001,10,BX,3(B)3(1)/LDP
indicates an unassisted double play by the first baseman who fielded the line drive and caught the runner off first base.

The double play notation can be extended in obvious ways to describe triple plays.

play,7,1,randw001,00,.>X,1(B)16(2)63(1)/LTP/L1
Note: the double digit combination 99, which cannot arise in play, is used to code unknown plays including forms that otherwise describe force outs and the double plays. Additional fielders in the double play are assigned 9. No assist or putout credits are given.

C/E2 codes catcher interference. Implicitly, the batter is awarded first unless overridden by an advance indicating otherwise. A redundant B-1 is allowed.

play,9,1,cruzj002,??,,C/E2.1-2
C/E1 or C/E3 are used when the pitcher or first baseman are called for interfering with the batter putting him on first without being charged with an at bat. In these cases C is interpreted as interference by the fielder specified following the E, not the catcher.

S$ single
D$ double
T$ triple
A hit (excepting a home run) is indicated by one of S, D and T optionally followed by the fielder, $, initially handling the ball. If more than one fielder handles the ball the appropriate sequence of fielders is given. The fielder designation is omitted if that information is not known. The batter advance to the designated base is implicit.

play,8,0,pacit001,??,,S7
is a minimal coding of a single showing that the left fielder first handled the ball. The ?? in the count field indicates the count at the time of the hit is unknown.
play,2,1,santn001,12,CFBX,D7/G5.3-H;2-H;1-H
codes a bases loaded double fielded by the left fielder, a modifier showing the hit location code and advances for each of the base runners.

play,3,0,raint001,11,CBX,T9/F9LD.2-H
describes a triple to right field, a hit location and a runner on second scoring.

DGR is the code for a ground rule double. No fielding player is specified.

play,3,0,surhb001,10,.BX,DGR/L9LS.2-H
E$ (or $E$) is the code for an error allowing a batter to get on base. The fielder making the error is given by $. The batter advance to first is implicit but may be given explicitly.

play,2,0,ruffb001,10,BX,E1/TH/BG15.1-3
indicates a throwing error (modifier "/TH") error on the pitcher with the runner on first advancing to third. The batter advance to first is implicit.
play,5,1,young001,00,X,E3.1-2;B-1
indicates a fielding error by the first baseman. In this case the batter advance to first has been explicitly given.

If the "E" is preceded by one or more numbers, these indicate fielders who were credited with assists on the play, e.g., 3E1 would indicate an assist for the first baseman and an error on the pitcher (presumably for dropping the first baseman's toss at first base).

FC$ Fielder's choice. $ is the fielder first fielding the ball. The batter advance to first is understood if it is not given explicitly.

play,4,0,harpb001,22,BBFSFX,FC5/G5.3XH(52)
The third baseman fielded the ball and threw home in time to retire the runner attempting to score. The batter was safe at first.
play,5,1,jordr001,00,X,FC3/G3S.3-H;1-2
The first baseman fielded the ball and attempted to throw an unspecified runner out. No outs were made and the batter is safe at first.

Note that even though force outs are considered fielder's choices, the notation distinguishes between force outs and non-forced fielder's choices.

FLE$ Error on foul fly ball.

play,5,0,murre001,00,F,FLE5/P5F
H or HR is the code for a home run leaving the park. The location modifier can be used to indicate where the ball left the playing field.

play,8,0,bellg001,21,CBBX,H/L7D
indicates a solo home run to left field.
play,12,1,bichd001,02,FFFX,HR/F78XD.2-H;1-H
shows a home run to center field with the runners on first and second scoring.

H$ or HR$ indicates an inside-the-park home run by giving a fielder as part of the code.

play,4,0,younr001,32,FBFFFBBX,HR9/F9LS.3-H;1-H

play,1,1,sandr001,32,C1FBB.BFB,W+WP.2-3
The fourth ball was a wild pitch allowing the runner on second to advance.
Base-running events not involving the batter
The player specified in these plays is the batter at the plate, not the base runner or runners affected by the play.

The play pitches and count fields (if given) are for the batter at the time of the event. Unless the event is a inning or game ending out it will be followed by another event listing the batter.

BK indicates a balk.

play,6,0,niekp001,??,,BK.3-H;1-2
CS%($$) is the event code for caught stealing. The bases, %, for this play are 2,3 and H. The fielding data, $$, is considered part of the play. Other advances may be given.

Event advances.

In addition to base runner movements, the advance
portion of an event indicates fielding, errors and has the indicators
indicating if a run is unearned and if an RBI is or is not
credited.

Bases are represented by one of five characters, 1
for first, 2, 3 and B or H for home. B is used when a batter advance
must be explicitly given. Scoring is indicated by a successful
advance that reaches home, H.

Separate advances are given for each runner on
base and are separated by a semicolon, ";". When more than one runner
advance is given for a play they are ordered starting with the runner
on third base and ending with the batter.

Advances may include additional information in the
form of one or more parameters specified as a parenthesized strings
of characters. When more than one parameter is given on an advance
they are individually parenthesized.

A successful advance is given in the form 1-2. The
dash "-" indicates a successful advance. Multiple base advances are
indicated with the same notation: B-2, 1-3, 1-H, 2-H. 

play,1,1,marte001,32,BBCBFFB,W.2-3;1-2

play,3,1,stilk001,11,CBX,S7/F7S.2-H;B-2

A runner put out at a particular base is indicated
by the "X": 2X3, 1XH. When a runner is out the advance gives the
fielding information as a parameter specifying fielders. The last
fielder gets credit for the put out and the others get
assists.

play,4,1,stubf001,32,CBFBBFFS,K/DP.1X2(26)
  
play,6,0,murre001,22,BSFFBX,9/F9LS/FDP.3XH(92)
  

play,4,0,blauj001,01,CX,S8/L78.BX2(8434)


Fielding errors are indicated by including an E in
the parameter following an advance. The fielder following the E is
charged with the error.

play,3,0,fielc001,00,X,S7/L7LD.3-H;2-H;BX2(7E4)

Following a second baseman error the batter is safe at second. The
error indicator negates the out. The left fielder is credited with an
assist.
  
play,7,0,puckk001,01,CX,S5/G5.1-3(E5/TH)

The parameter in this play attributes a throwing error to the third
baseman. A base indicator may follow TH, TH2 for example.


Parameters are used to indicate if a run is
unearned (UR) and if RBI is to be credited (RBI) or not (NR),
(NORBI). When these parameters are not present, normal rules are
followed.

play,9,0,davie001,30,BBBB,W+PB.3-H(NR);1-3

The run scored on the passed ball is not credited as an RBI to the
batter.
  
play,8,1,sax-s001,22,BCFBFX,S4/G34.2-H(E4/TH)(UR)(NR);1-3;B-2

Three parameters are given on the 2-H advance. The first indicates a
second baseman throwing error, the second indicates it is an unearned
run and the third indicates no RBI.
  

play,2,1,willk001,11,BFX,E6/G6.3-H(RBI);2-3;B-1

In this play an RBI is given to the batter.


Interference can be indicated with an advance
parameter. An alternative way of writing this is (5/INT).

play,2,0,stanp001,12,CCBX,S/L9S.3-H;2X3(5/INT);1-2

com,"$Gonzalez out for grabbing coach on way back to 3B"

Team unearned runs are indicated by TUR in cases
with more than one pitcher in the inning and the current pitcher is to
be charged with an earned run.

play,5,1,ashba001,??,,S9.3-H(TUR);2-H(TUR);1-3;BX2(93)

A U appearing in a fielding sequence indicates
the fielder handling the ball is unknown.

play,7,0,perrg001,21,B.BFX,S8.2-H;BX2(8U3)

In the 8U3 sequence most likely the U is the shortstop or second
baseman.

This notation is present in older files, but is no longer routinely used.

Advance parameters provide an
alternative way of indicating wild pitches and passed
balls.

play,5,0,feldm001,22,1LPB>F1S,K.1-2(WP)




Replay
Instant replay of home run calls was instituted on 8/28/2008. It was expanded at the start of the 2014 
season to include many other types of plays. For a more complete explanation and list all replays, see 
the following two pages.

https://www.retrosheet.org/ReplayHR.htm
https://www.retrosheet.org/Replay.htm

Each time the replay system is used, a slash tag is added to the play string. This will be /UREV for an 
umpire-initiated review and /MREV for a manager challenge. Immediately after that play there will be a 
comment record with details of the replay/challenge. The fields in this string are:

com,"replay,inning,Batter ID,Batter Team ID,Umpire ID,Ballpark ID,Reason,Reversed,Initiator,Team,Type

Ejections

Each time someone is ejected by an umpire, there will be multiple comments about the incident. This 
ejected person could be a player, coach, manager, trainer, mascot or fan. The first line will contain 
details in the following record format.

com,"ej,Ejectee,Job Code,Umpire ID,Reason"
   Ejectee: the ID of the person ejected
   Job Code
      P - Player
      M - Manager
      C - Coach
      T - Trainer
      N - Non-uniformed person
   Umpire ID: the umpire who ejected the person
   Reason: Short description

We have made an effort to standardize the text used in the reason field.

All following comments with be text describing the incident. It is most usual for it to be as simple as this.
com,"Babe Ruth ejected by HP umpire Tommy Connolly"

However, there are many ejections with more detailed text describing the incident.


Umpire changes during games

Occasionally, an umpire will be injured or develop an illness during a game. When there are changes to 
the umpire alignment during a game, there will be multiple comments with standardized fields to 
describe the change.

com,"umpchange,Inning,Position,Umpire ID"
   umpchange: standard text
   Inning: the inning in which the change took place
   Position:
      umphome
      ump1b
      ump2b
      ump3b
      umplf
      umprf
   This is the position with the new umpire
   Umpire ID: The umpire who changed positions. It is "(none)" if the position becomes vacant.
   These records are usually followed by a comment containing a text description of the reason.


Protests

When a manager protests an umpire ruling to the league office, a comment is added to the game to 
indicate the details of that protest. This comment is usually at the start of the game.

com,"Protest=Code"
   Code
      P - unidentified team
      V - disallowed protest by visiting team
      H - disallowed protest by home team
      X - upheld protest by visiting team
      Y - upheld protest by home team

Usually, there is a detailed comment at the spot in the game where the protest occurred.


Suspensions

When a game is suspended by weather or other conditions, a comment is added to the game to indicate 
the details of the suspension. This comment is usually at the start of the game.

com,"Suspend=YYYYMMDD,ParkID,Vis,Home,Outs"
    YYYYMMDD - completion date
    ParkID: if the game was resumed in another park from where it started
    Vis - visitor score at time of suspension
    Home - Home score at time of suspension
    Outs - Length of game in outs at time of suspension
